# 2021 CEP WA2 Proposal #

**By Kang Yiming** 

## Mission Statement ##

Create A RIICC Club Website.

## Requirements ##

I intend for the website to have these features:

- Introduction to RIICC

- Webpage for each branch of the club to allow the branch to give an introduction, achievement etc. 
- A showcase panel where club members can apply to get their project showcased on the club website when it is approved by an admin.
- "Hall of Fame" where every year's RIICC excos are displayed on the webpage. Also include a quote from every exco. Pictures of them(If they agree).

## Purpose ##

- Give Y1s/primary school students a better idea of what RIICC is about. 
- Foster a club identity.
- Display club achievements.
- A place to showcase and advertise their projects.
